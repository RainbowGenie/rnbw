# contributing to rainbow

a big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to rainbow!
contributions are always welcome, and you can quickly get your fix or improvement slated for the next release.
the contributorsâ€™ community can be found on [github discussions](), where you can ask questions, voice ideas, and share your projects.

## get started

1. fork the repository to your own github account.
2. clone the repository
    
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:username/rainbow.git
    ```
    
3. run the project from the root directory.
    
    ```
    npm install --force
    ```
    
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    
4. visitÂ `http://localhost:8080/`
5. create a branch locally.
7. follow the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/rnbwdev/projects/4/views/1) and take the first to-do that makes sense to you. go top-down.
    1. focus on the terms and specs for each task.
    2. make sure you fully understand it before you begin.
8. code!
    1. please keep the best practices and code style and follow any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo.
    2. collaborate. collaborate. collaborate. share what you do, did and will do.
9. commit changes to your branch. (donâ€™t rush to push the latest code to your branch. thatâ€™s a waste of time.)
10. keep your branch always in sync with the dev branch.

## pull requests
when reviewing a new PR, we prioritize testing the working functionality and then reviewing the code rather than the other way around.
shortly describe how you understand the issue and how you will resolve it. doing so helps ensure everyone is on the same page and can uncover mistakes.

in general, prs should:

- address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- include documentation in the repo or on our docs site.
- be tagged with the relevant corresponding issues.
- have a summary of your changes within the corresponding issues.

that's it! ðŸŽ‰
